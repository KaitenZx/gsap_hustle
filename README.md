# ‚ú® Glitchy Pixels Interactive Portfolio ‚ú®

This project is my deep-dive into the world of high-performance, animation-driven web experiences. It's a playground where I've pushed the boundaries of creative coding to build a portfolio that's as visually compelling as the art it showcases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Choices & Architectural Philosophy

This project was built with a specific philosophy: to blend artistic expression with robust, performance-first engineering. Here are the key architectural patterns and technologies that brought it to life.

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **The "Conductor-Orchestra" Hook Model:** Instead of monolithic components, all complex logic is deconstructed into specialized, single-responsibility custom hooks. Main components like `InfiniteGallery` act as "conductors," orchestrating these hooks. This keeps the component's JSX clean and declarative while isolating complex state management and side effects.

- **Custom Physics-Based Interaction:** I threw out native browser scrolling for the gallery. Instead, a custom interaction model built with **`GSAP Observer`** and **`InertiaPlugin`** provides a fluid, physics-based experience. This gives me absolute control over the feel of the scroll and enables a seamless, looping 2D grid.

- **Performance-First Rendering:** Every animation is built with performance as a core requirement.

  - **Main-Thread Offloading:** Heavy procedural animations are exiled to **Web Workers** with **`OffscreenCanvas`**, ensuring the main thread stays buttery smooth for user interactions.
  - **Adaptive Animation:** The background canvas animations are "smart." They self-throttle their own FPS and dynamically reduce their complexity (a technique I call "sparsity") during heavy user interaction, freeing up CPU resources when they're needed most.

- **Procedural Visuals with SDF:** The ASCII background effect in the "About Me" section isn't a video or a GIF. It's generated in real-time using **Signed Distance Fields (SDF)**, a mathematical technique that allows for creating and manipulating complex, organic shapes with code, producing a unique visual on every visit.

### Core Technologies

- **React 19:** The project is built on React 19. While the codebase currently employs manual memoization (`useCallback`, `useMemo`) typical of React 18 paradigms, it is fully configured with the **new React Compiler**. This makes the project forward-compatible and primes the complex, hook-heavy architecture for significant simplification in future refactoring.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** GSAP is the heart of all motion on the site. It's used for everything from orchestrating complex, scroll-based timelines with `ScrollTrigger` to implementing the custom physics model.

- **TypeScript:** End-to-end type safety for a more reliable and maintainable codebase.

- **Vite & SCSS Modules:** A fast, modern build setup with component-scoped styling to keep the CSS manageable and conflict-free.
